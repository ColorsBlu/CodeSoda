Hamming weight of a string is basically the number of bits that are different than the 0 symbol used .
ex- 11000000011
hamming weight =4

Hamming distance between two strings of equal length is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different.Heavily used in string comaprison like -motif finding.
